青蛙和他们的国王
The Frogs and Their Kings
很久以前，森林里有个美丽的池塘。青蛙们在那里快乐地生活。
“多么惬意的生活！在这儿我们拥有想要的一切。” 大家都很赞同。
“但是我们没有国王。” 一只青蛙说。“森林里的其他动物们都有自己的国王。” 
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful pond in the forest. The frogs lived there happily.
"What a pleasant life! We have everything we want here," they all agreed.
"But we have no king," said one frog. "The other animals in the forest all their own kings."
“是的，其他所有的动物都为自己的国王感到骄傲。” 另一只青蛙说。
“他们可能会因为我们没有国王欺负我们。” 
“让我们去找森林之神要一个国王吧。” 一只青蛙建议道。
"Yes, the other animals are all proud of their kings," said another frog.
"They might make fun of us because we do not have a king".
"Let's go find the Forest God and ask for a king," suggested one frog.
于是青蛙们来到森林之神面前。
“森林之神，你能帮帮我们吗？” 
“怎么了？” 
“我们想要一个国王。” 
“你们现在自由快乐。为什么想要一个国王？” 森林之神问。
So the frogs came up to the Forest God.
"Forest God, can you help us?"
"What is it?"
"We want to have a king."
"You are free and happy now. Why do you want a king?" asked the Forest God.
青蛙们做出了解释。“森林里的其他动物都有一个国王，只有我们没有。
他们可能会嘲笑我们。
森林之神，请给我们一个国王吧。” 青蛙们说。
“你们应该为你们拥有的感到庆幸。” 森林之神说。“不过既然你们坚持，我就满足你们的愿望。” 
The frogs explained. "The other animals all have a king. We are the only ones who don't."
"They might laugh at us."
"Forest God, please give us a king," the frogs said.
"You should be glad for what you have," said the Forest God. "But since you insist, I will grant you your wish."
快乐的青蛙们回到家等待自己的国王。突然，一根树干从天而降。噗咚！
“快跑，有东西在攻击我们！” 青蛙们哭喊着潜入池塘底部。过了一会儿，池塘恢复了平静。“哦，这一定是我们的国王。” 一只青蛙说。
The happy frogs went home to wait for their king. Suddenly, a log fell from the sky. Splash!
"Run! Something is attacking us!" cried the frogs, and they dove to the bottom of the pond.
After a while, the pond was quiet again. "Oh, this must be our king," said one of the frogs.
“是的，我们的国王来了。让我们向他致敬。” 但是青蛙们发现他们的国王一动不动。
“这只是一根木头罢了！” 一只青蛙说。
于是他们坐在树干上，还对它做鬼脸！
"Yes, our king has come. Let's go pay our respects to him". But the frogs found that their king did not move at all.
"This is nothing but a log!" said one frog.
So they sat on the log and even made faces at it!
青蛙们对他们的国王很不满意。
“多么傻的国王！我们的国王并不是一个真正的国王。” 
“其他的动物会戏弄我们的国王。” 
“让我们回去找森林之神要一个真正的国王。” 他们讨论着说。
于是青蛙们又来到森林之神面前。
The frogs were unhappy with their king.
"What a foolish king! Our king is not a real king."
"The other animals might make fun of our king."
"Let's go back to find the Forest God and request a real king," they discussed.
So the frogs came up to the Forest God again.
“神通广大的神！请赐给我们一个真正的国王。” 他们请求道。
森林之神对此感到很惊讶。
“嗯。好吧，我再给你们一个新的国王。” 他宣布道。
快乐的青蛙们回到家里等待新的国王。很快，一条鳗鱼出现在池塘里。
"All-Mighty God! Please give us a real king," they requested.
The Forest God was surprised at this. "Hmm. Okay, I will give you another new king," he announced.
The happy frogs went home to wait for the new king. Soon, an eel appeared in the pond.
“你们好！我是你们的新国王。” 他说，“让我们和睦相处吧。” 
“好极了！” 青蛙们很开心。“我们会听从您的指示。” 
但是温顺的鳗鱼从来没有发出任何命令。他只是享受地在池塘里游来游去。
"Hello! I am your new king," he said. "Let's get along well together."
"Great!" The frogs were happy. "We will follow your instructions."
But the docile eel never made any commands at all. He just enjoyed swimming around the pond.
于是青蛙们又召开了一次会议。
“这个国王不好。鳗鱼作为一个国王来讲太温厚了。” 
“你说得对。其他的动物也会嘲笑他。” 
“让我们再去找森林之神要一个更好的国王。” 他们说。
So the frogs called together another meeting.
"This king is no good. The eel is too good-natured to be a king."
"What you say is right. The other animals will laugh at him too."
"Let's go back to the Forest God again and demand a better king!" they said.
青蛙们再一次找到森林之神。
“神通广大的神，请给我们一个更好的国王。” 他们请求道。
“请赐给我们最强大的国王，不然我们会再回来的。” 
The frogs found the Forest God yet again.
"All-Mighty God, please give us a better king," they requested.
"Please give us the strongest king, or we will keep coming back to ask for another."
森林之神很生气。“我已经给你们派了两位好国王让你们能自由地生活。你们却不知足！好吧，我给你们派一个大的，强壮的国王！” 
青蛙们高兴地回家等待他们强大的国王。
The Forest God was angry. "I have sent you two good kings that let you live freely. But you were not satisfied! Very well, I will send you a big, strong king!"
The frogs went happily home to wait for their strong king.
“现在其他的动物们不会再嘲笑我们的国王了。” 他们说。
很快，森林之神派了苍鹭到池塘。当青蛙们看到苍鹭时很高兴。
“哦，看我们的新国王！” 
“他看上去如此高大完美！” 
"Now the other animals will not laugh at our king," they said.
Soon, the Forest God sent a heron to the pond. When the frogs saw the heron, they were happy.
"Oh, look at our new king!"
"He looks so tall and wonderful!"
但是苍鹭叼起一只青蛙吃掉了。
“天啊！快跑！快跑！” 其他青蛙哭喊道。
但是太迟了。苍鹭吞下了一只又一只的青蛙。池塘里一只青蛙都没有了。
森林之神看着苍鹭飞走了。“有的时候，人们应该学会满足于现在所拥有的。” 
But the heron picked up a frog and ate it.
"Oh my! Run! Run!" the frogs cried.
But it was too late. The heron devoured one frog after another frog until there were none left in the pond.
The Forest God watched the heron fly away. "Sometimes people should learn to be satisfied with what the have."
